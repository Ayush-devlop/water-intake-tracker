## 🏗 Architecture

The app uses a **single-file architecture** with screen-based navigation managed via React state. No external navigation library — pure React Native.

```

## 🤖 AI Development Process

This app was built using **Claude AI** as the primary development tool.

The AI assisted with:
- Architecture planning and component design
- Animated SVG progress ring implementation
- Complex multi-step onboarding flow
- Weekly bar chart and monthly heatmap logic
- Streak calculation algorithm
- Premium dark UI design system

Full AI conversation logs are available in `/ai-logs/`.

## 🏆 Contest Submission

**Challenge:** Build a Water Intake Tracker — Daily Hydration App  
**Platform:** 8x Engineer  
**Deadline:** May 13, 2026

## 📝 Reflection

### What was easy
- Setting up Expo and the base project structure
- AsyncStorage integration for data persistence
- Designing the dark premium color system

### What was challenging
- Animated SVG progress ring with gradient — required careful Animated API usage
- Monthly heatmap calendar — complex date calculation logic
- Multi-step onboarding with smooth transitions
- Keeping the single App.js clean and organized at 3500+ lines

### What I'd change
- Split into multiple component files for better maintainability
- Add actual audio files for sound effects (currently haptics-only)
- Implement backend sync for cross-device data
